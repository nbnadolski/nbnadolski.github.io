				<p><i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> is a tabletop role-playing game, or TTRPG where a group of people get together, roll some dice, and have a great time. The game
					uses pure imagination, since one of the players must be the <i>Dungeon Master</i>, in which they are in charge of controlling the story. Everything they say will need to be
					imagined by the other players. There are many useful tools online that new players can gain access to. One of which has a very useful tutorial and instructions 
					on how to play the game: <a href="https://dndbeyond.com">dndbeyond</a>.</p>
