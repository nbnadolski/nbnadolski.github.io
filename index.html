		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>My name is <b>Nick</b> and I am a Computer Science major at the Univeristy of Wisconsin - Madison. This is my third year attending 
		the <a href="https://ls.wisc.edu/">college of letters and science</a>. I enjoy hanging out with my closest friends when
		I have the time outside of class. I share many interests with them, and we enjoy having parties while playing games. Some of my
		biggest hobbies are playing <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and videogames.</p>
